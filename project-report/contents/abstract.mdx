**ABSTRACT**

Due to issues including counterfeiting, lack of transparency, and unauthorized data 
manipulation, it is necessary for today’s pharmaceutical industry to maintain the 
integrity and security of products throughout the supply chain. By improving security 
and traceability, a decentralized blockchain based system will provide a solution to the 
above-mentioned problem. In the proposed solution, manufacturers, stakeholders, 
and consumers are the three main parties. We have included seven stakeholders in 
this approach. Authorized manufacturers are allowed to store the drugs in the 
blockchain network and corresponding QR and bar codes are generated. Distributors 
and warehouses are among the stakeholders who update tracking records at each 
stage to guarantee transparency and prevent fraud. A reliable and unchangeable 
record of drug movements is produced by the decentralized structure, which ensures 
that no entity can change the data. Customers can scan QR codes to confirm their 
product’s authenticity and follow its journey. By offering increased transparency, 
reducing the risk of counterfeiting, and guaranteeing strong data security, this system 
solves the drawbacks of conventional pharmaceutical supply chains.

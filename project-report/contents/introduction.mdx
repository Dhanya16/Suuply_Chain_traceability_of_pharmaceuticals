**INTRODUCTION**

In today’s world, data is being generated immensely. Traditional methods that store 
data find it hard to maintain a huge amount of data. It is highly impossible to protect 
its integrity and provide security. In the absence of blockchain technology, the global 
pharmaceutical market faces a number of serious obstacles. The reputation of 
pharmacies is harmed by counterfeit medications, which also present serious health 
risks. It is challenging to trace the origin and flow of drugs, guaranteeing their 
authenticity and quality, due to supply chain transparency issues. The distribution of 
outdated medications is one of the many problems that pharmacies struggle to track, 
which could endanger patients. Without blockchain technology, the trust between 
suppliers and patients is destroyed. Moreover, patient data can be easily changed or 
accessed without authorization, making data security a serious concern. To improve 
the overall integrity and efficiency of the pharmaceutical industry, we use decentralized 
systems. Blockchain technology can address these problems by offering a safe, 
transparent, and unchangeable record of supply chain transactions. 

There are several limitations in the existing systems such as lack of transparency, 
mutability, data integrity and security. Traditional methods for supply chain traceability 
are less transparent and hence it becomes more difficult to track the movement of 
pharmaceutical products from the manufacturer to the consumer. The lack of 
transparency can lead to several issues like delay, difficulty in identifying where the 
problem has occurred, verifying the details of each transaction, etc. Moreover, without 
a clear view of the supply chain, it becomes harder to decide whether the product is 
genuine or not. Traditional databases can also be accessed by anyone and are not 
secure which means that the data can be tampered with. Once the data is stored, it 
can be changed multiple times. This results in reduction in reliability of data. Regular 
changes in data seriously affects the integrity and loses trust especially in handling 
data of pharmaceutical products. A small amount of tampering can have serious 
impact on consumers. Use of blockchain completely eliminates this problem.  

Traditional methods can lead to problems with accuracy and reliability of the data. It 
can lead to unauthorised access and also allow anyone with the access to database 
to alter the records. Hence it can lead to serious data integrity issues where the 
information stored becomes incorrect. Some approaches use centralised systems 
Blockchain  Based supply chain traceability of pharmaceuticals 
which means that a single central authority has the control and decision-making ability. 
In such systems all the operations are handled by the central authority. If there are 
any attacks or technical failure, then it effects the working of entire supply chain. Since 
only few stakeholders have control over the data it can also be less transparent. Since 
the pharmaceutical supply chains are vulnerable to rising costs, counterfeit drugs and 
increasing regulation, identifying the third-party vendors or risks, managing costs and 
tracking of drug can help ensure supply continuity. Blockchain allows the tracking of 
drug movements all the way from manufacturer to the patient’s doorstep. This project 
helps prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain and improves drug 
traceability.  

By using blockchain technology, the pharmacy industry can ensure a secure and 
transparent supply chain, which helps to eliminate the entry of counterfeit medicines 
into the market. Since blockchain technology tracks every drug’s movement from the 
manufacturer to the patient’s doorstep, it becomes easy to trace the drug’s origin and 
detect any signs of tampering or counterfeiting. The project includes real time 
monitoring of the drugs produced until they reach the consumer. Consumers can verify 
the track record and details of the product by scanning a QR code, which helps 
maintain transparency and security. There are many cases where we find non trusted 
manufacturer supplying expired drugs to the market. To prevent this, the project 
ensures that only authenticated manufacturers can participate in the supply chain. 
Regulatory compliance is a critical component in ensuring that medications are safe, 
effective, and of high quality. Establishing secure and transparent pharmaceutical 
supply chain, where the quality of the drug is maintained and is traceable is very 
important which is why we are introducing this system. 

As we discussed, one of the limitations of the traditional systems are that it gives rise 
to malpractices in the medical field. Transparency in supply of pharmaceutical 
products has become very crucial in this time. Our system tries to mitigate this problem 
of lack of transparency by tracing the journey of these products at each and every 
stage of its production. We give a unique id to each batch and all the records at 
different stages are recorded making the process transparent. In the above section we 
saw how data integrity and security is very important especially when it comes to 
healthcare products. Unlike traditional databases where data integrity is not 
maintained, our system uses Ethereum and data stored here are immutable. Once the 
data is stored in the blockchain, it cannot be altered. This ensures that the data is safe                                                                                                                     
Blockchain  Based supply chain traceability of pharmaceuticals 
and cannot be tampered. In our system, only certain authorized admins are given 
access to record the details in the initial stage making the system secure. Each admins 
are assigned an account and these account addresses are verified through MetaMask. 
This protects the integrity of data. Users can access every bit of the information about 
their products through a QR code which will be assigned to each batch during 
production. This ensures that users have enough information about the product they 
are consuming.  

There are other systems which use centralized permissioned blockchain to trace and 
track the products. Since those are centralized platforms, the reliability of the system 
reduces. A decentralized platform increases reliability and transparency. Our system 
uses a decentralized platform wherein all the verified stakeholders are allowed to 
record the details of the product. This ensures that the data is tracked at each and 
every stage of its production and its quality is maintained. Quality control test results 
are also recorded and the products that do not qualify the test are not allowed in further 
production. Using all these features our system tries to mitigate the problems present 
in current systems. A thorough literature review has been conducted and discussed in 
the next section to address the challenges of the current systems.

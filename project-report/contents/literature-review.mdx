**LITERATURE REVIEW**  

There are several supply chain traceability projects done in the field of blockchain. 
Bali, Vikram, et al. discusses one such project named PharmaChain. It’s a blockchain 
based solution for traceability. The traceability is achieved with application design and 
algorithms which are proposed in the work. The proposed application can be 
developed using Hyperledger fabric deployed on dockers. In this paper, authors have 
discussed three algorithms. First one is to add legitimate actors to the blockchain, 
second one is to add drug to the blockchain and the third one is for ownership transfer 
of the drug [1]. Liu, Xinlai, et al. proposes a blockchain based smart tracking and 
tracing platform using blockchain and IoT technologies. The objectives of the research 
include utilization of IoT solution combining QR code and RFID to achieve fine grained 
identity management for drug items. The proposed solution develops smart contracts 
for enabling a series of services including quality regulation service, traceability and 
visibility service, and risk analytics and smart alert services [2].The first reason to use 
blockchain technology is its security. It is designed to prevent any individual from 
modifying the data or transactions, this way blockchain can increase the trust. 
Moreover, blockchain facilitates the tracking of drugs through the entire supply chain. 
The private data of the patients is kept secret and their medical record will be used 
anonymously. The most important reason of using blockchain is the system of smart 
contracts [3]. Research done in [4] is about the various algorithms for creation of 
identities such as proof of work, delegated proof of authority, Delegated proof of stake 
etc. It also discusses about the various smart contract algorithms to validate the 
owners, sending out notifications etc. Number of pharma items were entered into a 
system to generate identity. The tasks to be done are discussed in detail in [5]. 
According to the proposed solution, the tracking of drugs involves manufacturers, 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, hospitals, pharmacies, wholesalers, distributors and 
patients. Manufacturers produce raw materials, pharmaceutical manufacturers 
produce the final product, hospitals and pharmacies store and dispense the final 
product dispatched by wholesalers and distributors and patients take the final product. 
Steps involved during transaction in drug safety is discussed in [6]. Transaction 
between participants consists of sender public key and digital signature, receiver 
public key and the information which is sent by the sender. It will be in QR code format  
Blockchain  Based supply chain traceability of pharmaceuticals 
which can be only accessed by receiver public key. Once the transaction is complete, 
its distributed to all the participants. 

Bocek, Thomas, et al. provided insights into the working of project modum.io AG. It 
combines IoT sensors with blockchain technology. Upon the delivery, a smart contract 
is executed to ensure temperature category compliance. These results are publicly 
accessible and reported back to the receiver as well as to the distributor [7]. As 
discussed in [8] about the integration of mobile application with NEM blockchain, all 
the drugs are labelled with QR codes. The proposed system provides support to the 
patient to cross check the validity of the medicine. This model allows only pharmacy 
shop people to have access. Bapatla, Anand Kumar, et al. also proposed QR code 
integration with blockchain mechanism. By doing this, various drug information along 
with track and trace information can be stored in a single place. Information about 
approvals, retailers, wholesalers, drug usage instructions, warnings, side effects, etc. 
is stored and accessed using a single QR code, providing transparency to consumers 
[9]. The generation of these QR codes to improve the security is discussed in [10]. QR 
codes consists of hash values that are generated by a hash function. It discusses 
about the ways to detect the authenticity of drugs. Designing a system to detect 
different kinds of anomalies anywhere along the chain such as missing nodes or 
invalid nodes in the distribution chain, primary data point discrepancies, timestamp 
anomalies etc. is proposed in [11]. Jaisimha, Divyashree, and Pranav Kumar 
determined whether blockchain can help detect counterfeit drugs by racketeers and 
inappropriate handling of drugs by distributors. Inter-system operability along with 
blockchain and smart contracts can enhance the productivity of the supply chain. This 
paper assesses whether blockchain helps improve the efficiency of the supply chain 
in the pharmaceutical sector [12]. [13] uses blockchain technology to make the 
pharmaceutical supply chain transparent, thus increasing trust among actors and 
ensuring security, authenticity, and traceability. It utilizes IoT solutions to verify the 
authenticity of drugs to monitor the environmental conditions during transportation. 
[14] addresses the challenges associated with counterfeit medicines and improves the 
integrity of the supply chain. It enhances the transparency and efficiency of the 
pharmaceutical supply chain while ensuring data privacy and security. The main 
objective of the research was to design and implement smart contracts that facilitate 
various services, including quality regulation, traceability, visibility, and risk analytics. 
The issues of missing data, endpoint switching, data dredging, and selective 
publication in clinical trials that undermine the scientific credibility of findings are 
proposed in [15]. It proposes the use of blockchain technology to prove the existence 
of documents describing pre-specified endpoints in clinical trials. 

Premkumar, Anitha, and C. Srimathi proposed solutions for overcoming the identified 
challenges and enhancing the efficiency, safety, and transparency of the 
pharmaceutical supply chain through the integration of blockchain and IoT 
technologies [16]. A technology which is based on the concept where each produced 
dosage unit has a unique information- rich pattern is used in [17]. This includes the 
manufacturing of the individualized dosage unit, the patient view for his/her personal 
blockchain, and integration of these drugs into a health internet of things system. 
Zhang, Ping, et al. talks about the usage of cloud storage with data signed by a private 
key to prevent forgery. Pharmaceutical cold chain monitoring requires reliable tracking 
of drugs and hence making it advantageous [18]. Decentralized storage systems 
provide lowcost off-chain storage for transaction data, ensuring reliability, accessibility, 
and data integrity through unique hashes stored on the blockchain [19]. There are 
many success factors in implementation of blockchain technology in pharmaceutical 
manufacturing. They are trust factors, real-time factors and immutable factors as 
discussed in [20].  

Several limitations were noted across these studies. One, being the poor internet 
connectivity in warehouses [7]. It becomes difficult to store the temperature and 
storage conditions of the drug. Immutability of records is also one of the limitations as 
once the data are recorded, they can’t be changed. Although immutability is 
considered as one of the main advantages of blockchains, it can be in conflict with 
emerging laws that address information storage issues [19]. Moreover, many existing 
solutions lack focus on user- friendly interfaces for all stakeholders, from 
manufacturers to end consumers. To address this, a system that prioritizes 
accessibility and ease of use across the entire supply chain using a web-based 
interface would be beneficial. In conclusion, while existing research has made 
significant strides in applying blockchain to pharmaceutical supply chains, there 
remain several key limitations to be addressed. By integrating smart contracts, 
decentralized storage, and user-friendly inter- faces, a more comprehensive, scalable, 
and efficient approach can be developed to ensure the integrity and traceability of 
pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Counterfeit medicines are prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry and pose a major 
public health risk and threats to patients’ safety. Most existing supply chain systems 
are poorly designed and executed to allow for proper tracking and verification of 
medicines from the time they are manufactured until they reach the patients.  

To resolve such challenges, the blockchain based system is developed, which 
provides end to end supply chain management with processes like automated 
verification and maintaining the integrity of pharmaceutical products across the supply 
chain.  

The main objective is to develop a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system 
that:  
➢ Creates and manages a secure and transparent system. 
➢ Ensure real time visibility and traceability.  
➢ Safeguard patients’ health.

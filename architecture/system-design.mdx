**SYSTEM DESIGN**

We intend to create a decentralized system to track and trace the supply chain of. 
pharmaceutical products. There are mainly three components, manufacturers, other 
stakeholders and consumers.

[Fig. 5.1](https://github.com/Dhanya16/Suuply_Chain_traceability_of_pharmaceuticals/blob/main/architecture/images/manufacturers.jpg) explains how the process takes place on the manufacturer’s side. 
Manufacturers first produce the required drug and then they make sure to record all 
the details regarding the contents in the drug and other information. Furthermore at 
this stage QR code and bar code are also generated. Later the produced drug 
undergoes lab testing. If it fails the test, the drug will be blocked from further process, 
else it is passed on to the next stage. This ensures that the drug produced is of utmost 
quality. 

[Fig. 5.2](https://github.com/Dhanya16/Suuply_Chain_traceability_of_pharmaceuticals/blob/main/architecture/images/consumers.jpg) explains how the process takes place on the consumer’s side. Either the 
consumers can order from pharmacies or the pharmacies will order in bulk. These 
order details are recorded in the blocks of the blockchain. When the pharmacy orders 
drugs, these drugs will be delivered to them and then the drugs will be dispensed by 
the pharmacy to the patients.

If the patients order drugs from the pharmacy then the drugs will be delivered to the 
patient’s home directly and the latter can scan the QR code to verify the authenticity 
of the drug. 

[Fig. 5.3](https://github.com/Dhanya16/Suuply_Chain_traceability_of_pharmaceuticals/blob/main/architecture/images/stakeholders.jpg) describes the involvement of various stakeholders in the system. The 
manufacturers send the produced drug for packaging. These packages are now labelled with the assigned QR codes. Manufacturers also send the barcode to each of 
the stakeholder to update the tracking records. This is done to prevent third party 
access but also make the system decentralized. These stakeholders do not have 
access to manipulate other data. Final quality control test is done to ensure that the 
packaging is rightly done. These finalized packages are now sent to distributors, 
logistic providers and warehouses. At every stage the details are recorded using the 
barcode scanner. 

The interaction between the consumer page and the pharmacy admin page plays a 
crucial role in ensuring a smooth transaction process. On the pharmacy admin side, 
there are four key functionalities. First, the pharmacy can place bulk orders directly to 
the manufacturer, ensuring an adequate stock of medicines. Second, the pharmacy 
admin has the ability to manage the inventory by adding new drugs, adding existing 
drugs when they are back in stock, and categorizing them accordingly. These updates 
made on the admin page are reflected on the consumer page, where users can browse 
drugs under various categories. Third, the pharmacy admin has access to a "verify" 
page where they can review the prescriptions uploaded by consumers when placing 
their orders. The pharmacy admin is responsible for verifying the prescriptions, and 
based on their review, they can either accept or reject the order. Lastly, there is an 
"orders" page, where the pharmacy can view the completed orders once the 
prescription has been verified and the payment has been processed.

On the consumer side, the page is designed with a straightforward process for 
ordering medicines. Consumers can browse the drugs available under different 
categories and add the required drugs to their cart. Once the necessary items are 
added, they are prompted to upload their prescription in the cart page before 
proceeding with the order. This prescription is sent to the pharmacy’s verify page for 
approval. After placing the order, consumers can track the status of their prescription 
under the "Orders" page, which will display whether the prescription has been 
accepted or rejected. If accepted, the consumer can proceed to the payment step, 
where they will be redirected to Razorpay’s API for secure payment processing. Once 
the payment is successfully completed, the order details are updated on the 
pharmacy’s orders page for further processing and delivery.
